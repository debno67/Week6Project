3D Printing and Education

With the emergence of 3D printers, comes endless opportunities for businesses, educators
and hobbyists.  This technology provides the ability to move away from 2-dimensional
diagrams and produce something tangible.  The introduction of this new technology
in the educational setting is moving rather slow.  Unfortunately, the folks who make
educational decisions don't have enough knowlege in this area.  It's believed that
3D printing will have the largest impact on grade school children.  The younger the
child, the easier it is to introduce new ideas.

The use of 3D printing would enable student's who learn visually, to see what they
are learning and enjoy the learning process.  The writers of textbooks could implement
files for 3D models at the end of each chapter, making a fun educational environment. 
The hands on approach is filtering down to history museums.  In the past, we could
only look at the artifacts at museums and not touch them.  Museums now have the ability
to create 3D replicas of those artifacts.  Children can touch the replicas and gain
a better understanding of what is being taught.

Until state and federal government agencies bring educational decision makers up to 
speed on 3D printing technology, schools and educators will continue to wait.  Once
3D printing becomes a part of the educational curriculum, we will see a higher level
of creativity in our kids.  It is speculated that once this technology hits the 
classroom, every student across the U.S. will be using their own school issued 3D
printer.
